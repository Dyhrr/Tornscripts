# 📁 Torn Script Vault

This is a personal repo where I collect useful scripts for the browser game [Torn](https://www.torn.com).  
I didn’t write these — this is just my curated stash. Think of it as a script toolbox.

Currently includes:
- ✅ 1 script (more might come if I get bored or obsessed)

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

- I got tired of losing good scripts
- I wanted to optimize or tweak them using Codex/AI
- Easier to update or track changes locally

---

## 🤖 Future Plans (Maybe)

- [ ] Let Codex clean up and optimize stuff
- [ ] Add my own tweaks if I grow a brain
- [ ] Build config UIs to toggle features

## 👤 About Me

I'm Nick — Service Desk Agent by day, degenerate Torn player by night.  
I didn’t write the scripts in this repo, but I use them, test them, and sometimes tweak them with the help of Codex or AI.  
This repo exists mostly so I stop losing track of good tools every time I reinstall or switch machines.

Also working on side projects like a local AI assistant named **Lex**, and a GPU-powered subtitle tool for streamers called **SubSplit**.  
Basically, if it's techy and automates something — I’m probably messing with it.

> If you're here looking for polished releases, wrong repo. If you're here to fix broken Torn UI, welcome to the vault.
