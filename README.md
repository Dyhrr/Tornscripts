# 📁 Torn Script Vault

This is a personal repo where I collect useful scripts for the browser game [Torn](https://www.torn.com).  
I didn’t write these — this is just my curated stash. Think of it as a script toolbox.

Currently includes:
- ✅ 1 script (more might come if I get bored or obsessed)

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

- I got tired of losing good scripts
- I wanted to optimize or tweak them using Codex/AI
- Easier to update or track changes locally

## 🤖 Future Plans (Maybe)

- [ ] Let Codex clean up and optimize stuff
- [ ] Add my own tweaks if I grow a brain
- [ ] Build config UIs to toggle features

## 👤 About Me

Just a regular Torn player who got tired of losing good scripts to dead links and buried forum posts.  
This repo is my personal stash — not a dev, just collecting and organizing the tools that make Torn less painful.

I didn’t write these scripts, but I might tweak or optimize them with help from AI if needed.  
If it breaks, it's probably my fault anyway.
